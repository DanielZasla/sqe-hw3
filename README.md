For example, in the case of the Moodle example you saw in the lecture, you can write something like this:

## How we tested
We used two different testing methods:
1. [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/), a BDD testing framework.
2. [Provengo](https://provengo.tech/), a story-based testing framework.

Each of the testing methods is elaborated in its own directory. 

## Results
You should add a report of your testing to the Report folder. See [Report README](Report/README.md) for more details on the report format.
